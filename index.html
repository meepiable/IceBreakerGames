<p>Because we have forgotten how to sing,
because we have forgotten how to sing.
Because we have forgotten, because we have forgotten.
Because we have forgotten how to sing.</p>

<p>Easy right? Now you change all the vowels into the ones of your choice. For example I will change the vowels into a:</p>

<p>Bacaasa wa hava fargattan haw ta sang,
bacaasa wa hava fargattan haw ta sang.
Bacaasa wa hava fargattan, bacaasa wa hava fargattan.
Bacaasa wa hava fargattan haw ta sang.</p>

<p>That was hard even typing it! Be careful not to say the ones that were silent e.</p>

<p>There should be more then 3 players(if not 3). The one in the middle should say pik and hit his/her head in the direction of the next player(the 1st player chooses the people). The one in the direction of the 1st player should say pak and do the same thing as the first player with choosing. The last player say boom and the one that person chooses is out(that person will hit his/her head in the direction). Repeat the steps.</p>

<p>If you didn't understand, sorry. I didn't when I first heard it.</p>

<p>Stand in a circle and the first person says "Zip zaga zip zaga zip pa boom!" While speaking, that person will do an action. The next one has to follow while the first does another one. Repeat the steps. If you can't do it, you're out. It is a game of remembering things.</p>
