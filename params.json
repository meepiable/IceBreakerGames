Now you change all the vowels into the ones of your choice. For example I will change the vowels into a:\r\n\r\nBacaasa wa hava fargattan haw ta sang,\r\nbacaasa wa hava fargattan haw ta sang.\r\nBacaasa wa hava fargattan, bacaasa wa hava fargattan.\r\nBacaasa wa hava fargattan haw ta sang.\r\n\r\nThat was hard even typing it! Be careful not to say the ones that were silent e.\r\n\r\n## IceBreaker2 is called Pik Pak Boom and here are the rules: \r\n\r\nThere should be more then 3 players(if not 3). The one in the middle should say pik and hit his/her head in the direction of the next player(the 1st player chooses the people). The one in the direction of the 1st player should say pak and do the same thing as the first player with choosing. The last player say boom and the one that person chooses is out(that person will hit his/her head in the direction). Repeat the steps.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't understand, sorry. I didn't when I first heard it.\r\n\r\n## IceBreaker3 is called Zip Zaga Zip and here are the rules of that game:\r\n\r\nStand in a circle and the first person says \"Zip zaga zip zaga zip pa boom!\" While speaking, that person will do an action. The next one has to follow while the first does another one. Repeat the steps. If you can't do it, you're out. It is a game of remembering things.",
